# Hasttar Web 3.0 BlockChain Application


<img src="client/images/dashbord.png">


Hasttar is my very first application that is based on web 3.0 its built using Solidity and React.js. <br/>
The main application of the project is for connecting and storing transactions on the blockchain.
User can use this application to send or receive Ethereum.<br/><br/>
Along with Solidity and React.js we are also using Metamask and Ganache<br/>
MetaMask which is nothing but a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain <br/>
and <br/>
Ganache -Truffle Suite we are using for building our personal Ethereum blockchain which we use to run tests, execute commands, 
and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.
